# ðŸ“˜ ML4022 â€“ Extra Homework 1 (Spring 2024)

This repository contains the implementation and solutions for **Extra Homework 1** of the *Machine Learning* course (ML4022) at **K. N. Toosi University of Technology**.

The assignment focuses on core linear algebra concepts such as positive definite matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, matrix decompositions, and their applications in machine learning. It also emphasizes performance comparisons between loop-based and vectorized implementations using NumPy.
